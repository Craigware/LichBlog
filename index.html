        <li>Created a simple entity system</li>
        <li>Created player movement</li>
        <li>Created an inventory system</li>
        <li>Created item data structures</li>
        <li>Created a primitive combat system</li>
        <li>Started working on AI navigation</li>
      </ul>

    <h4>Simple entity system</h4>
    <p>
      I have three different types of entities currently, dynamic entities, static entities, and etherial entities.
      <br>
      <strong>Dynamic entites</strong> encompass everything in the game that can move in a sporadic pattern. These are things like the player, bosses, and npcs.
      <br>
      <strong>Static entities</strong> are entities that don't tend to move. Examples of this would
      be houses, folliage, and points of interest.
      <br>
      <strong>Etherial entities</strong> are entities that can be interacted with but do not
      interact with the combat system at all. These are things like teleportation locations and
      item pickups.
    </p>

    <h4>Player Movement</h4>
    <p>
      The player utilizes a finite state machine in order to control actions.
      The state machine has 6 states, IDLE, MOVING, ROLLING, ATTACKING, CHANNELING, and STUNNED.
      Currently the only states that are implemented are IDLE, MOVING, and ROLLING.
      <br>
      When the player begins to move their movement speed ramps up over time, and when they stop it 
      decreases. I believe that movement is the defining factor in a lot of different games, and that
      honing this part will be integral to how fun the game will be.
      <br>
      The player also has the option to roll, forcing them in a direction at an increased velocity.
      Right now the player cannot influence the roll as it is being performed, I don't know if
      this will be the case further in development.
    </p>

    <h4>Inventory</h4>
    <p>
      The inventory system is pretty simple, currently im using an array that contains a class that has a reference to an item and a count.
      Later down the line when I allow the player to sort their inventories themselfs using an array here instead of a dictionary is going to
      make things simpler.
    </p>

    <h4>Primitive Combat System</h4>
    <p>
      I decided to use static library class and enum for using weapons. If the player performs and attack and a weapon is currently selected
      in their inventory, it calls Attacks.UseWeapon(weapon, caster) which figures out how the weapons hitbox should be calculated based off
      a WEAPON_TYPE enum, if there is a hit then Attacks.UseEffect(weapon, entity) is called with the hit entity using a WEAPON_EFFECT enum
      to decide what effect the weapon has, both use a bunch of switch cases BB.

    <h3>08-31-2024 Goals</h3>
    <p>
      My primary goal this month is getting systems created for the games core functionality.
      <ul>
        <li><s>Player movement and item management</s></li>
        <li>Standard enemies that persue the player</li>
        <li>Combat loop</li>
        <li>A leveling system</li>
        <li>Bosses with the capabilities of interacting with the world around them</li>
      </ul>
